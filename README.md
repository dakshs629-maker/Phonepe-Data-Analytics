# PhonePe Pulse 2024: Business Performance & User Analytics

## 📌 Executive Summary
This project analyzes a dataset of 300,000 transactions from 2024 to evaluate PhonePe's operational health. Using Python and Power BI, I identified revenue drivers and friction points.

## 📊 Key Business Insights
* **Revenue Mix:** Loans is the dominant engine, contributing over **$2.53 Billion**.
* **Success Rate:** The platform maintains a **96.00% success rate**.
* **Friction:** 4% of transactions fail, mostly due to **Server Errors** and **Wrong PINs**.

## 🧪 Statistical Validation
* **T-Test:** Proven difference in ticket size between Loans and Insurance ($p = 0.0$).
* **Chi-Square:** Proved that failures are linked to specific services ($p = 0.0$).

## 💡 Recommendations
1. Fix Server Errors to recover lost revenue.
2. Use Biometrics to stop "Wrong PIN" failures.
